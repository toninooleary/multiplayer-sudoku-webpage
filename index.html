                    <h3>Physical Game ideas</h3>
                    <figure class="row">
                        <figcaption>These physical demonstrations are of two different variations of Sudoku. In figure 1, the game takes inspiration from 'tug-of-war', where the players undergo a series of matches.
                            The winner of each moving a step closer towards their allocated goals. </figcaption>
                            <figcaption> Figure 2, the game introduces 'Tetris' and 'four in a row' like mechanics. The players aim to fill a row in the grid. 
                            Like Sudoku, there can only be one instance of each number within the row. Opponents can block each other by placing duplicate numbers, breaking the rules of the game.
                            When a row is filled, the player who fills the final number in the row gains a point. This is repeated until the grid has no more empty squares.</figcaption>
